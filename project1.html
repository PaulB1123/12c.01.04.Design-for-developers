          The purpose of the exercise was to use font hierarchy & designing UI cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, we have learned to use the fonts in a gray scale in the hierarchy of fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
           The second part of the project was to design UI cards and to learn how to choose a correct layout for the cards so they are easy to read and navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an overall of the project, I have learned the importance of choosing the correct font size ( being est in rem) and how to work with  height, margins, and paddings.

                    The font that I choose for this part as the header was GT-Super-Display, a strong with a powerful impact but still pleasant to the eye and for the paragraph was AktivGrotesk which is a light font that makes it very readable.

                  <p>
                    Understanding if the fonts work, I had to also display them on a smaller screen so I can test the readability of each one of them and how they work together. In the mobile version, you can still understand very easy the hierarchy.

                  These UI elements have been designed in this way so it will be easier for the user to scan as fast as possible through the information that is displayed. First, you can see the images, then the header because of the contrast with the other text and in the end, the buttons stand out because of the contrast of the colors and how they are displayed

                  Having shadow on an element while hovering makes the element easier to stand out and to be recognized, which makes it more intuitive to access. This is a small touch that can make a huge difference when it comes to more complex grids.

                  How you display the UI cards is very important for every good design. With the help of the GESTALT, we have learned how to put the accent on what matters in a card. Elements which were closer to one another belong to the same functionality.
